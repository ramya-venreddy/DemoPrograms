<p>The spatial element in Jenny continues with the principles of Jenny:</p>

<ul>

   <p>Provide a facade so that spatial will work the same on all platforms.</p>

   <p>Provide an easy to use interface.</p>

</ul>

<p>To use Jenny Spatial, you must specify "UseSpatial=true" in the Jenny properties file.  Further, you must specify
the type of each spatial column.</p>

<p>All of Jenny utilty classes have been extended to include extra fields for SpatialPoint, SpatialPolygon and
SpatialPolygon[].</p>

<p>Since Jenny's return types are string based and spatial types are compound objects, a format for storing
compound information was needed.  I'm generally not a fan of XML, but a new product has come out that has
changed my mind:  XStream (<a href='http://xstream.codehause.org'>xstream.codehause.org</a>).  The Jenny generated
facade wraps XStream to provide two methods: toXML() and fromXML().  So when you are handed XML, one method
gives you object.</p>
